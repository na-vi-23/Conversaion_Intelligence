# Natural languages processing 


An integral part of a chatbot development is the integration with Natural Languages Processing (NLP) services. Luckily, you donâ€™t have to write your own NLP algorithm. NLP empowers bots to strike natural conversation with a human, and is available as APIs from Google, Microsoft, IBM and Facebook.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) >= 2.0
- [TensorLayer](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer) >= 2.0

### Model

<table class="image">

### Training

```
python3 main.py
```


### Conversational Intelligence
This is where chatbot development goes complicated and can take more 200 hours of development and coding. Creating natural replies to give way to intelligent, meaningful conversation based on the NLP intents and entities is an endless journey. You want to make your chatbots as natural as a human, which is impossible. So, you keep improving it.

Moreover, each conversation must be tailored to a specialized algorithm and features a minimalistic navigation, so that it is easy for a user to start over. While you can use simple if-else trees, some state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms is what customers expect these days.
